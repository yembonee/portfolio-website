## About Me

I am an up and coming Full-Stack Web Developer. My experience and projects consist of what is currently on my github. The repositories represent the tasks I have done and the different languages and libraies/frameworks I have worked with. I started a Programming Bootcamp in September of 2023, and set to finish around February of 2024.
